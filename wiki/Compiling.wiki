#summary How to compile the source code and execute it successfully.

= Installing the Dependencies =

First of all, PU is programmed in [http://golang.org/ the Go Programming Language]. Follow [http://golang.org/doc/install.html Getting Started] in order to install Go on your machine.

We also use the newest SDL, SDL_ttf and SDL_image. These require other libraries too, let's install them:
{{{
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libpng12-dev libjpeg62-dev libfreetype6-dev autoconf subversion

hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL -r 0d221d6ffac8
cd SDL
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_ttf -r a6e04cc57348
cd SDL_ttf
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_image -r b1c1ec3a8d49
cd SDL_image
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
}}}


= Compiling! =

Let's checkout the newest PU:
{{{
svn checkout https://pokemon-universe.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pu
}}}

In order for the client and server to compile, you must install the packages in the `Packages` directory. However, calling `make` will automate this together with compiling the client and server.
{{{
cd pu
make
}}}
