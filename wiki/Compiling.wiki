#summary How to compile the source code and execute it successfully.

= Installing the Dependencies =

First of all, PU is programmed in [http://golang.org/ the Go Programming Language]. Follow [http://golang.org/doc/install.html Getting Started] in order to install Go on your machine.

We also use the newest SDL, SDL_ttf and SDL_image. These require other libraries too, let's install them:
{{{
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libpng12-dev libjpeg62-dev libfreetype6-dev

hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL
cd SDL
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_ttf
cd SDL_ttf
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_image
cd SDL_image
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
}}}
